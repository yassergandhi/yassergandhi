## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🎓 huhuGERMAN — Pedagogical System with Identity Resolution

University students needed reliable asynchronous writing feedback. Authentication was unreliable, and email formats were inconsistent on mobile.

**Outcome:**
- Formalized curriculum logic into executable schemas.
- Built resilient identity resolution (no login required).
- Ensured auditability via structured observability.

**Tech:** Astro · Supabase · Zod · PostgreSQL · Google Apps Script  
**Links:**  
- Student UI: https://satzbaudeutsch.netlify.app/  
- Identity Engine Repo  
- Portal Repo

### ⚙️ Resilient API Integration Demo (Fault Injection)

A sandbox environment that simulates real production errors (401s, 500s, latency) to practice diagnosis and implement support-ready tooling.

**Highlights:**
- Injects latency and failure through SDK.
- Displays Trace IDs, Latency, Status Codes inside UI.
- Enables diagnostic reproducibility without backend access.

**Tech:** React · TypeScript · Tailwind  
**Demo:** https://huhugerman-demo-cse.netlify.app/
