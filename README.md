# 👋 Yasser Gandhi Hernández Esquivel


I work at the intersection of **technical systems and human experience**. My background combines:

- **Systems Web** — Universidad de Guadalajara
- **Pedagogy** — UNAM Master's degree
- **German Literature** — UNAM Bachelor's
- **15 years** teaching and translating complex rules into clear, executable steps

## 🔍 What I do

I help SaaS teams **diagnose friction** in their products before it becomes tickets or churn.

- **Integration troubleshooting** — REST APIs, 401/403/404/500 errors, payload validation, authentication flows
- **Technical onboarding** — reduce time-to-value by identifying cognitive and technical gaps
- **Request/response analysis** — browser DevTools, HAR inspection, end-to-end flow tracing
- **Cross-functional communication** — translate between engineering, product, and customers
- **Documentation & enablement** — turn ambiguous errors into actionable guidance

I don't claim titles I haven't earned.  
I offer **diagnosis, observation, and structured problem definition** — skills validated by 15 years of detecting *false understanding* in complex systems.

## 🧠 Featured Project

### [huhuGERMAN](https://github.com/yassergandhi/huhugerman) — Implementation & Support Demo

**Status:** 📦 Archived Learning Artifact (no active users, no revenue)

Originally built for real university students (UAM-Azcapotzalco), later refactored to simulate **production support workflows**. This project demonstrates:

- **Incident reproduction** — controlled injection of 401/404/500 errors to practice diagnosis
- **API validation** — request/response inspection, payload verification
- **Observability** — trace IDs, latency metrics exposed for troubleshooting
- **Support-oriented documentation** — runbooks, ADRs, post-mortem templates

*This profile is a living document. I am actively seeking opportunities in **technical onboarding, implementation support, and integration diagnostics** — preferably remote, with DACH or Latin American teams.*
