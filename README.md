# Yasser Gandhi Hernández Esquivel
### Customer Success Engineer · Application Support · Software Implementation

I work at the intersection of customers, product, and engineering, supporting successful SaaS implementations through technical onboarding, API integrations, and structured troubleshooting.

My focus is on reducing Time-to-Value by diagnosing integration issues early, validating request/response flows, and identifying root causes before escalation to engineering. I am comfortable reading code, inspecting network traffic, and debugging REST-based systems in production-like environments.

## What I do

- Technical onboarding and software implementation for SaaS products  
- API integration debugging (REST, JSON, authentication, error handling)  
- L1/L2 application support (401 / 403 / 404 / 500 errors, latency, retries)  
- Frontend inspection and request flow analysis (React, TypeScript, browser DevTools)  
- Cross-functional communication with non-technical stakeholders

## Featured project

### HuhuGerman — Application Support & CSE Demo

A production-inspired demo designed to showcase real-world application support and customer success engineering workflows.

Originally used by real users, later anonymized and refactored to simulate common SaaS integration issues such as authentication failures, API latency, and server-side errors.

**Focus areas:**
- Incident reproduction and troubleshooting workflows  
- API request/response validation and payload inspection  
- Operational diagnostics and request tracing  
- Support-oriented documentation and customer enablement  
- Demonstrating CSE and Implementation skills rather than feature development
