**Customer Success Engineer | Software Implementation & API Integrations**

I work at the intersection of customers, product, and engineering, supporting successful SaaS implementations through technical onboarding, API integrations, and structured troubleshooting.

My focus is on reducing Time-to-Value by diagnosing integration issues early, validating request/response flows, and identifying root causes before escalation to engineering. I am comfortable reading code, inspecting network traffic, and debugging REST-based systems in real-world production-like scenarios.

## What I do

* Technical onboarding and software implementation for SaaS products
* API integration debugging (REST, JSON, authentication, error handling)
* L1/L2 technical troubleshooting (401 / 403 / 500 errors, latency, retries)
* Frontend inspection and request flow analysis (React, TypeScript, Network tab)
* Cross-functional communication with non-technical stakeholders

## Featured project

### Huhugerman — Customer Success Engineering Demo

A React/TypeScript implementation demo designed to simulate real-world integration challenges such as API latency, authentication failures, and server errors.

The project focuses on:

* Troubleshooting workflows and retry logic
* Operational diagnostics and request tracing
* “Self-healing” documentation and support enablement
* Demonstrating CSE and Implementation skills rather than feature development
